# SwissTravel

Switzerland is a country filled with many places to visit, but many tourists don’t know how to plan their trip efficiently. With **SwissTravel**, organising a full trip in Switzerland is easy!  

Select a few places you absolutely want to visit, how long you plan to stay, your interests — and let the app sort out everything else. Are you an active traveler? SwissTravel will make sure to fill the gaps in your perfect plan, ensuring you never get bored!  

Take pictures of your trip and pin them on the map to show your friends and remember how beautiful your trip was. The app will also evaluate if your trip is enjoyable by judging the **intensity level** of your itinerary.
