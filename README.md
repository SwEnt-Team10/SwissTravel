# SwissTravel

Switzerland is a country filled with many places to visit, but many tourists don’t know how to plan their trip efficiently. With **SwissTravel**, organising a full trip in Switzerland is easy!  

Select a few places you absolutely want to visit, how long you plan to stay, your interests — and let the app sort out everything else. Are you an active traveler? SwissTravel will make sure to fill the gaps in your perfect plan, ensuring you never get bored!  

Take pictures of your trip and pin them on the map to show your friends and remember how beautiful your trip was. The app will also evaluate if your trip is enjoyable by judging the **intensity level** of your itinerary.  

Do you struggle navigating a city you’ve never been to? We’ll make sure to guide you there in no time, using the method of your choice! And if a step of your trip disappoints you or is faster than expected, don’t hesitate to use the **live feature** to find cool activities nearby. This allows extra flexibility for your journey.
