# SwEnt M2 Team Grading Report

The M2 feedback provides an opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you are performing in the project. By now, you should be building upon the foundations set in M1, achieving greater autonomy and collaboration within the team. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The feedback focuses on how well your team has applied good software engineering practices, delivered user value, and collaborated effectively. We assessed the quality and maintainability of your implementation, the clarity of your design, and the consistency of your delivery and teamwork across Sprints. An important component is how much you have progressed since the previous milestone. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M2 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md) document. As mentioned in the past, the standards for M2 are elevated relative to M1, and this progression will continue into M3.

## Green Belt

You qualified for a Green Belt 🥋🟢 and got a final grade of 4.86/6 for M2. Great job! You're building solid foundations.

| **Final Grade**                          | **4.86 out of 6**   |            |                                           |

In addition to the feedback you received from the coaches during the Sprints, you will find some extra feedback below.

---

## Implementation (APK, code quality)

We evaluated your APK’s functionality, stability, and user experience, along with the quality and consistency of your code. We also reviewed your CI setup, Sonar integration, and tests, including the presence of at least two meaningful end-to-end tests and the line coverage achieved.

The user profile is automatically created (can't choose your name). THe user also can't edit his personal informations.  
Most of the times no suggestions are proposed when writing arrival/departure locations. When it happens it is extremely slow and no exact locations are possible. 
When no suggestions are given the user can't move forward as these are required fields to fill. 
The algorithm works backward. It starts wih the arrival location and ends with the departure location. 
When filling the "locations you already know yo want to visit", only city names come up. and you can't erase what you wrote after the first suggestion appears. Also can't delete one place you put you want to visit but don't want to anymore, even befrore comfirming. 

You have three files for the end-to-end tests, one of which is completely commented out and should probably be removed.

For this part, you received 5.08 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Features

We evaluated the features implemented in this milestone. We looked for the completion of at least one epic, as well as the use of at least one public cloud service, one phone sensor, and a concept of authentication.
We assessed how well the implemented features align with the app’s objectives, integrate with existing functionality, and contribute to delivering clear user value.

You correctly implemented the requirements concerning the usage of cloud service, and sensors.
However, the features you implemented do not yet meet the expectations for this stage of the course. 
You will need to put in significant work for the last deliverable.

For this part, you received 4.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Figma and Architecture Diagram

We evaluated whether your Figma and architecture diagram accurately reflect the current implementation of the app and how well they align with the app's functionality and structure. 

The Figma is pretty complete and the UI looks pretty good. The Figma would benefit from being a bit ahead of your app so that you already know what direction to take in the future.

The architecture has really improved since the last time, well done! Next time you should replace the one in the Wiki because currently the Wiki still figures the first one, which was cleafly incomplete. Now we can clearly see the different part of the application architecture and how everything is coming together. Keep up the good work!

For this part, you received 5.25 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog

We assessed the structure and clarity of your Sprint and Product Backlogs and how you used them. We looked at whether your tasks are well defined, appropriately sized, and aligned with user stories; whether the Product Backlog is well organized and value-driven; and whether the Sprint Backlog is continuously updated and demonstrates good planning and prioritization.

The sprint backlog is populated with tasks for the next sprint, and most of them are assigned and have a time estimate. You should add description for tasks whose title is not exactly self explanatory to make it clearer.

The product backlog contains a lot of user stories that are sorted by priority which is a good point. You should try to rely even more on it for prioritising what you will be implementing in the future sprints.

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Scrum Process (documents, autonomy)

We evaluated your ability to autonomously run and document the Scrum process. We looked at how well you documented your team Stand-Ups and Retrospectives for each Sprint. We also assessed your level of autonomy in organizing and conducting these ceremonies, defining and prioritizing user stories in your Product Backlog, and planning well-scoped Sprint tasks that lead to concrete, valuable increments.

The scrum documents are well filled every sprint, well done. You could improve even further by coming to the Friday meeting having already filles the team retrospective sheet. This way you would simply discuss it again with us.

The team is getting more and more autonomous, leading the Friday meetings according to the defined schedule. Keep up the good work!

For this part, you received 5.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Consistent Delivery of Value

We reviewed your team’s ability to deliver meaningful increments of value at the end of each Sprint.  
We assessed whether your progress was steady, visible, and tied to concrete user value and app functionality, in line with your Product Backlog objectives.

While the trip algorithm is strating to take shape, the value added between sprints is sometimes unclear or not enough. You should set more concrete goals to yourselves, and put in more effort. 

For this part, you received 3.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Summary

Your team grade for milestone M2 is 4.86/6. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Keep up the good work and good luck for the next milestone!
